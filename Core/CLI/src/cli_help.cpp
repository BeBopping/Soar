		"Characters can also be escaped with a backslash (so string literals with\n"
		"embedded pipes and spaces outside of string literals are both possible).\n"
		"gp is primarily intended as an alternative to :template rules for reinforcement\n"
		"learning. :template rules generate new rules as patterns occur at run time.\n"
		"Unfortunately, this incurs a high run time cost. If all possible values are\n"

		"allowing code to run faster. gp is not appropriate when all possible values are\n"
		"not known or if the total number of possible rules is very large (and the\n"

		"possible to combine gp and :template (e.g., if some of the values are known and\n"
		"not others). This should reduce the run time cost of :template.\n"
		"There is nothing that actually restricts gp to being used for RL, although for\n"

		"papers/sutton-92a.pdf.\n"
		"Delta Bar Delta (DBD) is implemented in Soar RL as a decay mode. It changes the\n"
		"way all the rules in the eligibility trace get their values updated. In order\n"
		"to implement this, the agent gets an additional learning parameter \"meta-\n"
		"learning-rate\" and each rule gets two additional decay parameters: beta and h.\n"
		"The meta learning rate is set manually; the per-rule features are handles\n"
		"automatically by the DBD algorithm. The key idea is that the meta parameters\n"
		"keep track of how much a rule's RL value has been updated recently, and if a\n"
		"rule gets updates in the same direction multiple times in a row then subsequent\n"
		"updates in the same direction will have more effect. So DBD acts sort of like\n"
		"momentum for the learning rate.\n"
		"To enable DBD, use \"rl --set decay-mode delta-bar-delta\". To change the meta\n"
		"learning rate, use e.g. \"rl --set meta-learning-rate 0.1\". When you execute\n"
		"\"rl\", under the Experimental section you'll see the current settings for decay-\n"
		"mode and meta-learning-rate. Also, if a rule gets printed concisely (e.g. by\n"
		"executing \"p\"), and the rule is an RL rule, and the decay mode is set to delta-\n"
		"bar-delta, then instead of printing the rule name followed by the update count\n"
		"and the RL value, it will print the rule name, beta, h, update count, and RL\n"
		"value.\n"
		"Note that DBD is a different feature than \"meta\". Meta determines whether\n"
		"metadata about a production is stored in its header string. If meta is on and\n"
		"DBD is on, then each rule's beta and h values will be stored in the header\n"

		"The run command starts the Soar execution cycle or continues any execution that\n"

		"cause Soar to execute until it is halted or interrupted by an action of a\n"
		"production, or until an external interrupt is issued by the user. The run\n"
		"command can also specify that Soar should run only for a specific number of\n"

		"action or the stop-soar command). This is helpful for debugging sessions, where\n"
		"users may want to pay careful attention to the specific productions that are\n"
		"firing and retracting.\n"
		"The run command takes optional arguments: an integer, count, which specifies\n"
		"how many units to run; and a units flag indicating what steps or increments to\n"
		"use. If count is specified, but no units are specified, then Soar is run by\n"
		"decision cycles. If units are specified, but count is unpecified, then count\n"
		"defaults to '1'. If both are unspecified, Soar will run until either a halt is\n"
		"executed, an interrupt is received, or max stack depth is reached.\n"
		"If there are multiple Soar agents that exist in the same Soar process, then\n"
		"issuing a run command in any agent will cause all agents to run with the same\n"
		"set of parameters, unless the flag --self is specified, in which case only that\n"
		"agent will execute.\n"
		"If an environment is registered for the kernel's update event, then when the\n"
		"event it triggered, the environment will get information about how the run was\n"
		"executed. If a run was executed with the --update option, then then event sends\n"
		"a flag requesting that the environment actually update itself. If a run was\n"
		"executed with the --noupdate option, then the event sends a flag requesting\n"
		"that the environment not update itself. The --update option is the default when\n"
		"run is specified without the --self option is not specified. If the --self\n"

		"  system, including all chunks built during problem solving and all default\n"
		"  productions.\n"
		"* Timing Information --- Might be quite detailed depending on the flags set at\n"
		"  compile time. See note on timers below.\n"
		"* Decision Cycles --- The total number of decision cycles in the run and the\n"
		"  average time-per-decision-cycle in milliseconds.\n"
		"* Elaboration cycles --- The total number of elaboration cycles that were\n"
		"  executed during the run, the average number of elaboration cycles per\n"
		"  decision cycle, and the average time-per-elaboration-cycle in milliseconds.\n"
		"  This is not the total number of production firings, as productions can fire\n"
		"  in parallel.\n"
		"* Production Firings --- The total number of productions that were fired.\n"
		"* Working Memory Changes --- This is the total number of changes to working\n"
		"  memory. This includes all additions and deletions from working memory. Also\n"
		"  prints the average match time.\n"
		"* Working Memory Size --- This gives the current, mean and maximum number of\n"
		"  working memory elements.\n"
		"\n"
		"The stats argument --memory provides information about memory usage and Soar's\n"
		"memory pools, which are used to allocate space for the various data structures\n"
		"used in Soar.\n"
		"The stats argument --rete provides information about node usage in the Rete\n"
		"net, the large data structure used for efficient matching in Soar.\n"
		"The --max argument reports per-cycle maximum statistics for decision cycle\n"
		"time, working memory changes, and production fires. For example, if Soar runs\n"
		"for three cycles and there were 23 working memory changes in the first cycle,\n"
		"42 in the second, and 15 in the third, the --max argument would report the\n"
		"highest of these values (42) and what decision cycle that it occurred in (2nd).\n"
		"Statistics about the time spent executing the decision cycle and number of\n"
		"productions fired are also collected and reported by --max in this manner. --\n"
		"reset zeros out these statistics so that new maximums can be recorded for\n"
		"future runs. The numbers are also zeroed out with a call to init-soar.\n"
		"The --track argument starts tracking the same stats as the --max argument but\n"
		"records all data for each cycle instead of the maximum values. This data can be\n"
		"printed using the --cycle or --cycle-csv arguments. When printing the data with\n"
		"--cycle, it may be sorted using the --sort argument and a column integer. Use\n"
		"negative numbers for descending sort. Issue --stop-track to reset and clear\n"
		"this data.\n"
		"\n"
		"A Note on Timers\n"
		"\n"
		"The current implementation of Soar uses a number of timers to provide time-\n"
		"based statistics for use in the stats command calculations. These timers are:\n"
		"\n"
		"* total CPU time\n"
		"* total kernel time\n"
		"* phase kernel time (per phase)\n"
		"* phase callbacks time (per phase)\n"
		"* input function time\n"
		"* output function time\n"
		"\n"
		"Total CPU time is calculated from the time a decision cycle (or number of\n"
		"decision cycles) is initiated until stopped. Kernel time is the time spent in\n"
		"core Soar functions. In this case, kernel time is defined as the all functions\n"
		"other than the execution of callbacks and the input and output functions. The\n"
		"total kernel timer is only stopped for these functions. The phase timers (for\n"
		"the kernel and callbacks) track the execution time for individual phases of the\n"
		"decision cycle (i.e., input phase, preference phase, working memory phase,\n"
		"output phase, and decision phase). Because there is overhead associated with\n"
		"turning these timers on and off, the actual kernel time will always be greater\n"
		"than the derived kernel time (i.e., the sum of all the phase kernel timers).\n"
		"Similarly, the total CPU time will always be greater than the derived total\n"
		"(the sum of the other timers) because the overhead of turning these timers on\n"
		"and off is included in the total CPU time. In general, the times reported by\n"
		"the single timers should always be greater than than the corresponding derived\n"
		"time. Additionally, as execution time increases, the difference between these\n"
		"two values will also increase. For those concerned about the performance cost\n"
		"of the timers, all the run time timing calculations can be compiled out of the\n"
		"code by defining NO_TIMING_STUFF (in kernel.h) before compilation.\n"

		"The watch command controls the amount of information that is printed out as\n"

		"information is printed as Soar runs. At the lowest setting, 0 (--none), nothing\n"
		"is printed. The levels are cumulative, so that each successive level prints the\n"
		"information from the previous level as well as some additional information. The\n"
		"default setting for the level is 1, (--decisions).\n"
		"The numerical arguments inclusively turn on all levels up to the number\n"
		"specified. To use numerical arguments to turn off a level, specify a number\n"
		"which is less than the level to be turned off. For instance, to turn off\n"
		"watching of productions, specify --level 2 (or 1 or 0). Numerical arguments are\n"
		"provided for shorthand convenience. For more detailed control over the watch\n"
		"settings, the named arguments should be used.\n"
		"With no arguments, this command prints information about the current watch\n"
		"status, i.e., the values of each parameter.\n"
		"For the named arguments, including the named argument turns on only that\n"

		"When activation is enabled, the system produces a cache of results of calls to\n"

		"(i.e. 64-bits, currently) and the number of cache items is computed as follows:\n"

		"decay-rate will dramatically change this profile. For instance, keeping\n"
		"everything else constant, a decay-thresh of 0.3 requires ~2.7GB and 0.2\n"
		"requires ~50TB. Thus, the max-pow-cache parameter serves to allow you to\n"
		"control the space vs. time tradeoff by capping the maximum amount of memory\n"
